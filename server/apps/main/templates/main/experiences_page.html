              everything
              sounds even louder and feels even more intimidating. As a kid, I never understood why it was so hard and
              my parents would often
              get mad at me for ‘misbehaving’ in public. I’d just meltdown whenever we went out to eat. Waiting for the
              food felt like some kind of marathon and I just got so overwhelmed. But now that I’ve realised hunger
              exacerbates my sensory differences I know how to cope. I try to make sure I’ve eaten something before I go
              out and a while back I bought some earplugs which are great for small and bustling places. Looking at
              menus beforehand also helps as I can better prep myself and focus on adjusting to the environment rather
              than debating what to eat.</p>

                limited screen settings. 3/ 4 are too bright for me but my family dislikes the fourth option. I don’t
                often watch telly with the family but I feel like I should have the option to. It just feels unfair, I
                get that I’m a minority but they don’t see what I see and the fact that they won’t adapt to my needs
                upsets me. My parents are constantly nagging me to spend less time in my room but it’s situations like
                this that make me do just that. I can regulate my input in my own space and I can’t elsewhere.

            <p class="story-card-text">My lack of spatial awareness is probably the most debilitating part of my autism.
              I’m constantly walking into door frames and tripping over the corners of furniture even in my home. And
              have a terrible habit of walking backwards into old women in shopping aisles. It’s been super hard with
              COVID as I’ve had to be in full ‘defensive mode’ whenever I go out, making sure I’m not too near to
              anyone.
            </p>
            <p class="story-card-text">However, I feel it most when I’m playing sports. I think I’m marking someone but
              they're actually
              halfway across the pitch. Or I call for the ball thinking I’m in a clear space, when in reality there’s
              three players standing right behind me. It’s even harder if there’s more than one game going on as I find
              it hard to focus on just one sound and I tend to use my hearing as a way of working out whether people are
              near me or not. Because autism is an invisible disability I feel like people don’t understand and just see
              me as a bad player. At times this gets really upsetting. It takes so much effort for me to participate in
              group activities because of my social anxiety, so if I feel like I’m under performing it sometimes gets
              too much.
