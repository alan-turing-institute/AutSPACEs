## What are the summary documents?

This folder contains summaries and quotations from a moderation co-creation workshop held with autistic people, the relatives and carers of autistic people, and researchers from the Alan Turing Institute about the Autistica/Turing citizen science project (AutSPACEs).

We want to share the insights from our conversations to help others understand how they can best support autistic people by creating welcoming and inclusive spaces online. 

The summary document is a collection of anonymised quotes from session participants.

Quotations have been shortened or summarised, labelled according to the speaker (see the [key](./README.md#key) in the README file), and all information has been depersonalised.

These summaries have been circulated to all participants to offer them the opportunity to remove or modify their comments if they wish.
Based on the feedback receieved, three quotations were changed or removed by participants so that they better reflected their views. 

In total, the session included 3 autistic people, 3 parents of autistic people, and 2 people who were both autistic themselves and the parents of autistic people.
They were also attended by researchers from The Alan Turing Institute and Autistica. 

## How was the report created?

### 1. Design moderation session agenda:

An agenda for each session was written to loosely guide the discussions. 
These were based on researcher knowledge of what was important to investigate and determine from a developer and researcher prespective, as well as from the input of autistic poeple, their relatives and carers, in earlier focus groups.
A presentation was created by a researcher which included comments from autistic participants about their priorities, in order to guide the discussions. 

### 2. Run moderation session <img src="../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Conversation_2041500.png" width="150" align="right"/>


Participants came to an online session run over Zoom to discuss how to moderate the AutSPACEs platform and to help co-create a code of conduct for the platform. 

All participants from Autistica's Insight Group were paid in line with Autistica's policy and involve guidelines.

The session was recorded.

### 2. Transcribe discussion <img src="../images/noun-project-icons/noun_transcript_532343.png" width="150" align="right"/>

All data from the focus groups were collected and processed in accordance with the project's data management protocols for in-person sessions.

The discussion was written down word-for-word, except that no personally identifying information was included in this document.

Personally identifying information includes:

* Names of individuals
* Precise ages
* Schools, workplaces, universities, and addresses

The recordings were then deleted.

### 3. Collect anonymised quotes <img src="../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Document_188540.png" width="150" align="right"/>

Quotations were taken from the document, shortened, and organised into groups based on common themes.

The quotations were labelled to show whether the speaker is autistic, or the parent or carer of someone autistic, if they are one of the project's researchers, and which organisation they come from.
The quotes are also labelled to show whether the speaker is talking directly about their own experience, indirectly about someone else's experience, or generally about a group's experience.
This labelling system was co-designed by a researcher and an autistic collaborator.

The resulting, organised and labelled insights were sent to participants.

### 4. Review the summary document <img src="../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Eye_2040041.png" width="150" align="right"/>

All participants had a chance to review the summary document and make changes.
They were given 14 days to do this. All participants from Autistica's Insight group were paid £30 for this additional work.

We asked them to:

1. Understand the purpose of the document and what is going to happen with the insights.
2. Understand the information in the document.
3. Ensure the information is appropriately anonymised.
4. Send us any requested changes.

The document was then changed on the basis of this feeback. Additionally, some quotations were removed in line with a commitment to be autistic-voice first. Participants were shown which quotations were removed and all were content. 

## How will the Moderation Report be used?

### Publish insights online <img src="../images/noun-project-icons/noun_online_1632606.png" width="150" align="right"/>

The moderation report is published online at: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/community-recommendations/moderation-co-creation/moderation-report.md.

The quotes can be used by anyone and for any purpose.
Anyone using the information must credit the Autistica/Citizen Science community.

Potential users include:

* Future contributors to this project who want to add to or use the insights from the moderation session. 
* Autism researchers and advocates who want to make sure they are serving the needs of autistic people.
* Parents, friends and colleagues who want to better understand how to support an autistic person they know.

### Write down platform requirements <img src="../images/noun-project-icons/noun_todolist_1128326.png" width="150" align="right"/>

The suggestions from the moderation session are being used to create a moderation proceess, code of conduct, and guidelines for reporting on behalf of others. This process is being led by two participatory researchers.
Work relating to moderation can be found under the "Moderation" Milestone in this repository. 

We can't do everything, but we will try our best to follow the suggestions included in the summaries.
