# Project News

The most recent updates on the project and it's progress can be found [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/project-management/project-updates).

A lot of our resource has been going towards roadmapping the project and ensuring all our issues are up to date! 
Our latest roadmap can be found in our github repository [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/project-management/project-roadmap).

## Autistica Festival 

Autistica held their annual festival this month 12-16 July. You can find information on what aspects were discussed at their [website](https://www.autistica.org.uk/get-involved/research-conference/research-festival-2021-programme). 

We had Georgia and Susanna talk about the AutSPACEs project and it got some great responses! Thank you to you both for all your hardwork on that. 

They usually upload all recordings of the festival on their youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOczrUsUjmBbUMPT0HIgGKg/featured).

## Contributor Spotlight

Today we are spotlighting on Susanna Fantoni who has been a key contributor to the AutSPACEs moderation work! 

**Tell us a little about yourself...**

I’m Susanna Fantoni and I’m nearly 26. I was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of three and then autism when I was 15.
 
I went through most of my education without an autism diagnosis and by the time I got it, was already approaching sixth form.
So I never received sufficient support.
 
In 2012, I was unfairly forced to leave school due to my epilepsy and mental health. 
I joined my local FE College where I thrived. I got myself a place at the University of Sussex where I not only completed a degree but my Master’s also!
 
Since then I’ve been on what I call a prolonged hiatus. In 2019 my epilepsy got really bad and then in 2020, COVID came along. 
But thanks to AutSPACEs, I’m now back on track.

**What are your favourite hobbies/things to do:**

My long-term special interest is Doctor Who. However, I’m a big fan of TV in general as well radio.
 
At the moment my main hobby is knitting. I started knitting in 2019 after I had surgery and wanted to find something I could do from bed whilst recovering.
 
Since then my biggest achievements have been: a striped jumper for myself, a buttoned waistcoat for my grandpa and a beautiful shawl for my grandma. I’m also working on several pairs of socks as I get bored when repeating something so jump from project to project quite a lot. 

I’m also a writer and am trying to get back into reading via audiobooks.

**What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?**

I first participated in AutSPACEs as part of a focus group but I’m now co-leading the moderation team. 
 
We’re working on creating the Code of Conduct (CoC) for the site and the methods through which submitted stories will be assessed. As a lot of users will be autistic people, there needs to be a fair system that prevents potentially harmful content from being published but also makes sure the users understand why their content is inappropriate. 
 
This is why creating a CoC that gets information across clearly is so important. Having other autistic people involved is key to this, not only to make sure it is understandable, but also to assure we don’t miss anything out. After all, everyone is different.

**Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:**

In full honesty, my main tip would simply be to just come along. This project is vast, which means if we’re not already working on something you’re interested in, we probably will be at some point. You may also discover a whole new interest.
 
I’ve never worked on moderation before but it’s a perfect fit. It mixes my interest in ethics with my logical mindset. And also pulls in the knowledge I have from my MA in Digital Media. 
 
There really is a purpose for everyone in this project, even if it’s just giving your opinions/feedback. So, if you have the time and interest, there’s really no reason not to come along and see what you think. 

## Project Opportunities

### Spreading the word

We currently are looking for opportunities to spread the word of the project to increase paricipation. 

If you have any ideas for this, we would love to know, please send your ideas via email to [Lotty](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).
This could be anything from talks with charities/univeristies or posts in various communications channels that you are a part of. 
Please share any information with any individuals who you think would be interested in joining and contributing to the project.

### Opportunities for contribution

There are lots of areas, as defined above, where you can get involved in the project. 
If you are not too sure where to get started here are a few beginner issues which are a great place to start:

**"Collate content for the platform's About page."** [Issue #529](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/529)

**"Add accessibility requirements as checklist."** [Issue #522](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/522)

**"Create a promotion pack for AutSPACEs project." **[Issue #516](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/issues/516)

If any of these issues seem interesting, please comment on this issue if you have a GitHub account. 
If you don't have an account no worries! 
Simply send [Lotty](mailto:ccoupat@turing.ac.uk) letting her know that you would like to contribute. 

## Project Information

### Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute to and give us their thoughts and ideas.
Is it really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members. 
We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*  Research
*  Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*  Platform development
*  Accessibility and Inclusion 
*  Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or to suggest another working group, please email Lotty at [ccoupat@turing.ac.uk](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our repositories for the [Project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) and for [Platform Development](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed and here we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. 

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, the [Turing Way Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html) has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement.
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!
