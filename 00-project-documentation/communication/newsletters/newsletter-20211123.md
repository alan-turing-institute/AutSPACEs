# November Newsletter

Hi everyone!!

Thank you for opening and reading November's newsletter.
We are so happy you are here!
We hope you are enjoying the beautiful colours of the season, and have lots of nice things to look forward to in the Autumn and Winter. 
Change is the one thing that seems to stay constant, and it affects everyone differently. 
So, if anyone is struggling with these challenging times, we hope that the citizen science community can offer you support and connection.

Email [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to let us know if we can help you with involvement, and do feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us.
They can sign up by following this link: https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience.

Best wishes for everyone!

### Design work for the AutSPACEs platform

Sophia (a.k.a. 'Agenda Bot') and Soledad have been busy working on user experience research and a design system for the AutSPACEs platform. 
This will help make sure the platform is built on community members' true needs. 
Sophia and Soledad presented on AutSPACEs [personas](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-research/Personas) and [information architecture](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs/design-architecture) for the most recent meet-up session. 
You can find information about the design and user research work [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/tree/master/platform-designs). 
Anyone is invited to get involved via. our Issues and Pull Requests on GitHub. 
Take a look at the [Design Milestone](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%226.+Design+for+MVP%22) to find out more.

### Code of Conduct Presentation
Susanna and James have been busy working on a code of conduct. 
Susanna presented the first draft the code of conduct for the most recent meet-up session. :tada: You can find the draft [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhBlUxMVv8F_QGuY1re2xbLLZ-mNmak4TISmC-nFW58/edit). 
Anyone is invited to get involved via. our Issues and Pull Requests on GitHub. 
Take a look at the [Moderation Milestone](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/milestone/27) to find out more.

### Method Paper Presentation to Whitakerlab
Georgia delivered a paper to The Whitaker Lab at The Turing Institute about a method combining participatory research, citizen science, and open source. 
You can view and download the slides for the presentation on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5615381).

### Mozfest 2022 Application in the Neurodiversity and Wellbeing Space
Sophia and Georgia submitted a proposal to present on AutSPACEs in the 2022 MozFest, a festival of open science. 
If the proposal is accepted, will be looking for autistic collaborators to co-present. 
It's an exciting opportunity. 
Good luck 🤞

Anyone is invited to join in the user research, design or moderation work by taking part in our development sessions on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of the month, or our meet-up sessions on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays.

## Contributor Spotlight

Today we are spotlighting on **Amol Prabhu** who has been a key contributor to the AutSPACEs via meet-ups, paper writing and data management.

> **Tell us a little about yourself...**
>
>Hi, my name is Amol! 
I’m working at the Turing Institute on a 6 month secondment from the Civil Service Fast Stream. 
Previously I worked at a Fintech startup and before that I spent a few years working at pubs at bars while I was studying at Queen Mary University of London. 
I’m super interested in Biology which led me study up to MSc level in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. 
I am currently based in East London where I live with my wonderful husky, Panucci! 
>
>**What are your favourite hobbies/things to do:**
>
>I love listening to and writing music! 
I am influenced by all styles from indie rock to jazz to hip hop and electronic stuff. 
I play several instruments but mainly play guitar and sing in a band making dreamy guitar music. 
I love reading about ecology, anthropology and evolutionary biology and going on long hikes with Panucci. 
I also love cooking and while there is no method to my culinary madness, I usually find that improvising in the kitchen yields pretty tasty results! 
>
>**What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?**
>
>I have joined the AutSPACEs project pretty recently so have mainly been observing the community meetups but I aim to focus working on paper writing, data agencand transparent data management. 
>
>I also hope to contribute by making outputs from previous focus groups accessible and available for researchers and other groups to use and gain insights to meet the aims of the project with a big focus on transparent, accessible and reproducible data. 
>
>**Give your best tips and tricks for contributing**
>
>Keep up with the progress of the project through the newsletter, signing up to mailing lists and coming along to the community meetups! 
I joined in simply observing for the first couple and the community is really welcoming, don’t be afraid to ask questions and ask how you can contribute and support - the best way to come up with ideas is by discussing it with the community!

## Project Information

Get involved.
Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute to and give us their thoughts and ideas. 
It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members. 

We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*  Research
*  Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*  Platform development
*  Accessibility and Inclusion 
*  Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or to suggest another working group, please email Georgia. 
If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our repositories for the Project and for Platform Development. 
If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed and here we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. 

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, the Turing Way Book has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. 
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!
