## Formatting the newsletter

*This information is for members of the project team who have write access to the TinyLetter mailing list.*

Rather than formatting the newsletter in the TinyLetter page, please use this markdown to html converter tool: [https://www.browserling.com/tools/markdown-to-html](https://www.browserling.com/tools/markdown-to-html).

Combining free text and markdown can introduce strange layout changes (really large fonts and odd spacings) that are not easy to spot until you've sent the newsletter.
You are more likely to successfully send a nicely formatted newsletter by converting markdown to raw html and entering that into TinyLetter dashboard.
