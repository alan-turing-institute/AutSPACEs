### Meet-up sessions

We've had three recent online meet-ups (8 April, 22 April and 13 May) where we have focused on the scope of the project and moderation of the platform and its stories. 
We have presented the Platform Development so far and ideas for Community Engagement and we have, of course, introduced our new members as above.
I would like to thank everyone who is getting involved with these meet-ups as contributions from the community is key in ensuring this project progresses!

To catch up on the meet-ups, please find the summaries on our [Meet-up Website](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-the-AutSPACEs-Meet-Up-Page-0ad17d5c0f8045be8618686531068622).

### We are on Twitter!

AutSPACEs has a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AutSpaces)!
Please go and give us a follow!

We post a lot of our project updates and advertisements for AutSPACEs on there, so it is a great platform to keep up to date with. 

If you are social media savvy we would love to hear from you and get input into running the account, sharing it, and using it to promote the platform.

### We have a Slack Channel!

We also use Slack as a communication channel to advertise to our community our latest events and project progress and any opportunities for wider persepctives and comments. 

To use Slack you will have to create an account which is quick and easy and then you have full roam of what Slack has to offer.

We want to use this as a channel to get information, provide comments and thoughts but also to chat with others in the AutSPACEs community.
So overall, it's a great place to get involved.

To join the Slack channel you will firstly need to go through [Open Humans Slack](https://slackin.openhumans.org/) and set up an account and once that's done then follow this [link](https://openhumans.slack.com/archives/CNMECPNCD) to our channel. 

### Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute to and give us their thoughts and ideas.
Is it really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members. 
We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*  Research
*  Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*  Platform development
*  Accessibility and Inclusion 
*  Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or to suggest another working group, please email Lotty at [ccoupat@turing.ac.uk](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our repositories for the [Project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) and for [Platform Development](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed and here we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. 

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, the [Turing Way Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html) has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement.
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility! 

## Project Opportunities

We currently are looking for opportunities to spread the word of the project to increase paricipation. 

If you have any ideas for this, we would love to know, please send your ideas via email to [Lotty](ccoupat@turing.ac.uk).
This could be anything from talks with charities/univeristies or posts in various communications channels that you are a part of. 
Please share any information with any individuals who you think would be interested in joining and contributing to the project.
