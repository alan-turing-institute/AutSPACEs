## Project Information

### Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. 
It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

* Communication, Engagement and Promotion
* Platform development
* Accessibility and Inclusion
* Moderation

If you would like to join one of these groups, meet and work with other autistic people, or suggest another working group, please email [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk). 
If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our repositories for the [Project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) and for [Platform Development](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed and here we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved.

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, the [Turing Way Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html) has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement.
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!
